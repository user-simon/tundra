# Examples

The following examples are provided: 
- [Minimal](minimal.rs): the least amount of code to get a Tundra project up and running; a good starting
point for new projects. 
- [Tally](tally.rs): a simple state where a tally is incremented when the user presses up. 
- [Landlord](landlord.rs): a more advanced state with a table of rent units the user can interactively add
and remove rows to.

# 🏔️ Tundra

Tundra provides a framework and utilities for creating interactive terminal applications with Ratatui. 

Ratatui is a comprehensive library for creating singular user interfaces in the terminal, but lacks features
for organizing larger applications — composed of several interfaces — and for receiving user data input. 

Tundra aims to extend the functionality of Ratatui with utilities for: 

- Defining application states. 
- Managing the terminal environment and context. 
- Displaying messages through modal dialogs. 
- Receiving user input through input forms and fields. 

It is **not** intended to be a replacement for or wrapper over Ratatui, nor the backend. Ratatui is still
required to draw the user interface of each application state, and the backend is still required for
low-level terminal operations.
